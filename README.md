# Nellie | Globalchat Version 9

Welcome to the most advanced Globalchat System since discord.py rellease.
<br>Nellie was created in 2018 during a development Project called: Neko's Dev Hood.
<br>After this Project nobody have updated the Code so far, so _yes_ it is _not_ the one plus ultra of best Practice!

_What we have?_

- A customizable multichannel cross server chat system
- Moderation Systems for every Room
- few fun commands
- a big public chat room
- Chatroom Owner Commands
- Custom Roles
- the possibility for everyone to have a Globalchat without a personal Bot!



_The Concept behind Nellie_


![Conncept](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55553342/135154507-c9b3d328-3ad1-4cc7-a09c-ece39562c048.png)



<br>
<br>Every Chatroom has his own "bubble" where they can chat to eachother. 
<br>The other "bubbles" does not have connection to them.
<br>Every "bubble" is a separate Cross Server Chat with own Members in it. 
<br>The Roomowner (the Dude that has created the Room u know) can Flag Mods for his own Room, or do other fancy stuff.
<br>Every Mod has the permission to mute or ban Members out of this Chatroom. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

_Known Bugs_

- Some commands may have few issues
- Bad english translation
- json data storage (to be honest, we were lazy)
- redundant code blogs
- no help menu (the website might be offline)



_Why we end this amazing project?_

- We've lack of marketing 
- The libery in which the bot is written is out of date/not updated anymore
- lack of time
- everybody has his/her own Globalchatbot now 
- the project group exsist no more




Thanks for the Fish!
Perhaps i will see u later!
